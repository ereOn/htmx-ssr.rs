Development of `htmxology` happens on GitHub. We appreciate your help!

## Required Tools

As a prerequisite, you need to have the following tools installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) - `cargo install just`

Then just type `just dev-setup` to install the other required tools and
dependencies automatically.

To build the project, its examples and documentation, type `just`.
